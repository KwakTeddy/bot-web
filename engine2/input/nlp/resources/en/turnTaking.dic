I pulled this map from the Net.	1	0	0.0
I don't think!	1	0	0.0
Any time.	1	0	0.0
I’ll make a few inquiries and get back to you.	1	0	0.0
Are you okay?	3	2	0.4
You have me confused with somebody else.	1	1	0.5
Hi, it's a pleasure to meet you.	1	0	0.0
You read my mind.	1	0	0.0
Well, his condition has stabilized.	1	0	0.0
We could easily jump on the subway.	1	0	0.0
I’m paranoid.	1	0	0.0
It's a piece of my cake!	1	0	0.0
That’s a remarkable achievement!	1	0	0.0
You'll do fine.	1	0	0.0
It wasn’t that.	1	0	0.0
I like to think that I am, thanks.	1	0	0.0
Well, give me a ring.	1	0	0.0
The movies and sports appeal to me.	1	0	0.0
The battery must have kicked it.	1	0	0.0
I should have left my vehicle at home.	1	0	0.0
We had visitors today.	1	0	0.0
Good move.	1	0	0.0
That’s what I figured.	1	0	0.0
Oh no I'm not!	1	0	0.0
I blundered badly.	1	0	0.0
What shall I tell her?	1	0	0.0
I don’t care which way you go.	1	0	0.0
I'm so steamed!	1	0	0.0
There’s nothing thrilling, I’m afraid.	1	0	0.0
You have my eternal admiration.	1	0	0.0
There’s a thing on tonight.	1	0	0.0
Make an itemized list every time you go and stick to it, no matter what.	1	0	0.0
Yes, it is.	1	1	0.5
I thought so.	1	0	0.0
I’m giving blood today.	1	0	0.0
It’s like going through culture shock.	1	0	0.0
That’s not cool.	1	0	0.0
It comes down to attitude.	1	0	0.0
Classic scenario.	1	0	0.0
The beach is calling me.	1	0	0.0
You won’t believe this.	1	0	0.0
I’ve been there before.	1	0	0.0
Go easy on me.	1	0	0.0
I recently had my palm read.	1	0	0.0
She just stepped out.	4	0	0.0
It’s funny, isn’t it?	1	0	0.0
I’m at a loss.	1	0	0.0
It's all my fault.	1	0	0.0
There’s not much to tell, I’m afraid.	1	0	0.0
It hurts me, just looking at it.	1	0	0.0
We just flew by one a minute ago.	1	0	0.0
It’s no wonder why Jill is well liked.	1	0	0.0
We have no choice.	1	0	0.0
Ooh!	1	0	0.0
It has to be done this Friday.	1	0	0.0
You said you had important news.	1	0	0.0
It’s a nail-biter, that’s for sure.	1	0	0.0
It’s all about will.	1	0	0.0
It’s oil and it’s of a cool valley full of deep colors.	1	0	0.0
That’s a good way of putting it.	1	0	0.0
That makes only one of us happy.	1	0	0.0
That place is always really good.	1	0	0.0
I bumped into Mr.	1	0	0.0
You seem out of it these days.	4	0	0.0
How about a drink?	1	0	0.0
That’s scary.	1	0	0.0
Very true.	1	0	0.0
I’ve got an eyelash in my eye!	1	0	0.0

I won’t have to buy anything, will I?	1	0	0.0
Coffee or hot chocolate.	1	0	0.0
You’re kind.	1	0	0.0
I'm sorry about that.	1	0	0.0
Oh no!	1	0	0.0
That was bad of me.	1	0	0.0
You shouldn't have, but I love it.	1	0	0.0
Make her happy.	1	0	0.0
Oh, there's just a piece of paper stuck.	1	0	0.0
I get it that you’re miffed.	1	0	0.0
We will.	1	0	0.0
There's more beer in the refrigerator.	1	0	0.0

Bite your tongue!	1	0	0.0
What’s the problem?	2	0	0.0
You go right ahead.	1	0	0.0
Sorry to hear that.	1	0	0.0
That’s a bite.	1	0	0.0
That's a great tradition your family keeps.	1	0	0.0
They gave me my proper praises.	1	0	0.0
You can keep it.	1	0	0.0
You demand too much of yourself.	1	0	0.0
It's fun for me, too.	1	0	0.0
Look at your hands quivering.	1	0	0.0
I am so gung-ho for Net shopping.	1	0	0.0
You don’t say!	2	0	0.0
I’m sick and tired of Bob brownnosing the boss all the time.	1	0	0.0
You know what the place looks like.	1	0	0.0
You seem rather distant.	1	0	0.0
You moved just last year!	1	0	0.0
I did some gardening.	1	0	0.0
I’m on a mission.	1	0	0.0
Check you out!	1	0	0.0
I’m so hungry, I could eat a horse.	1	0	0.0
I wish it weren’t true, but it’s sitting on the rim.	1	0	0.0
I’d like that.	1	0	0.0
Banish the thought.	1	0	0.0
I’d like some, as well.	1	0	0.0
You’re barking up the wrong tree.	1	0	0.0
I’m running a little late.	1	0	0.0
I was at a LIVE venue all night.	1	0	0.0
It would be nice if you gave something useful for the new pad.	1	0	0.0
Little by little.	1	0	0.0
We’ve been going around in circles.	1	0	0.0
Bite your tongue.	1	0	0.0
I just got the word.	1	0	0.0
It’s such a major hassle.	1	0	0.0
Wear what you want.	1	0	0.0
Don’t get close to me.	1	0	0.0
Don’t be too hasty.	1	0	0.0
It was smooth.	1	0	0.0
Don’t the stories bring you down?	1	0	0.0
She’s alright in my book.	1	0	0.0
Forgive me for calling late.	1	0	0.0
I get that.	1	0	0.0
I don’t know what to say.	1	0	0.0
I’m a Scorpio, but I’m not into that hocus-pocus.	1	0	0.0
Ah, you're the rookie.	1	0	0.0
It's a beautiful day!	1	0	0.0
It’s been ages since I’ve seen your kids.	1	0	0.0
What’s wrong with your voice?	1	0	0.0
There’s nothing this place doesn’t have.	1	0	0.0
I think I left my phone in a taxi.	1	0	0.0
I'm sick and tired of Ms.	1	0	0.0
I’m way into it.	1	0	0.0
Thanks, Sharon.	1	0	0.0
That’s too bad.	1	0	0.0
You have my phone number.	1	0	0.0

I've been talking to Steve and Dick about hiking this weekend.	1	0	0.0
Big chunks of metal speeding down the road.	1	0	0.0
That depends.	1	0	0.0
No argument here.	1	0	0.0
That story is making the rounds.	1	0	0.0
You can have it.	1	0	0.0
Good we'll play.	1	0	0.0
Don't get so cocky.	1	0	0.0
I just don’t get it!	1	0	0.0
He’s been keeping his nose clean for so long!	1	0	0.0
Sign me up.	2	0	0.0
I've got to concentrate on what I'm doing.	1	0	0.0
I couldn’t get to sleep last night.	1	0	0.0
Sounds like heaven on earth!	1	0	0.0
Please pass along my best regards.	1	0	0.0
It’s hard to tell.	2	0	0.0
It’s a good thing, you know.	1	0	0.0
Bundle up before you go out.	1	0	0.0
Yeah, that’s one of the perks of summer, too.	1	0	0.0
It was great as usual.	1	0	0.0
You are one of the politest people I have ever known.	1	0	0.0
Look.	1	0	0.0
Do you seriously think so?	1	0	0.0
Your car engine is running rough.	1	0	0.0
Do me a favor and have a taste of this stew I’m making.	1	0	0.0
What are your monthly payments like?	1	0	0.0
Never, it we keep talking.	1	0	0.0
I’d rather a flat screen TV.	1	0	0.0
They’re showing a late-nighter at the local theater.	1	0	0.0
Never a dull moment.	1	0	0.0

Getting in a panic won’t help.	1	0	0.0
You missed a good one.	1	0	0.0
Just be wise.	1	0	0.0
Do you mean to say you don’t even know her name?	1	0	0.0
So, it might just delayed?	1	0	0.0
That’s a bit extreme.	1	0	0.0
That’s a given, but it doesn’t matter.	1	0	0.0
My daughter got sick.	1	0	0.0
It’s almost lunch time.	1	0	0.0

Hi!	1	0	0.0
I’m having a spate of bad luck.	1	0	0.0
I said we spent too much money.	1	0	0.0
I’m sure that’s got him down.	1	0	0.0
Hi.	1	0	0.0
You don’t understand.	1	0	0.0
It's up to you.	1	0	0.0
Quch!	1	0	0.0

It’s a splendid day!	1	0	0.0
Are you a smart phone wizard, yet?	1	0	0.0
Well, I was, but the fact of the matter is that I got laid off.	1	0	0.0
All true, but it can’t be slowed down.	1	0	0.0
“Play the field Eddie” is getting hitched?	1	0	0.0
I don’t mind if I do, thanks.	1	0	0.0
Keep out of this.	1	0	0.0
You’re acting all jazzed up, today.	1	0	0.0

That’s so wonderful!	1	0	0.0
Snap out of it!	1	0	0.0
Hm, let's go up half a size.	1	0	0.0
Oh it‘s real all right.	1	0	0.0
